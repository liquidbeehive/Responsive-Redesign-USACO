        <h3><p>We are looking forward to a competition season in 2023-2024 with four contests, much like in previous years. At the end of the season, teams will be chosen to represent the USA at the International Olympiad in Informatics in Egypt and the European Girls Olympiad in Informatics in the Netherlands.</p>

            <p>Two important notes regarding changes / clarifications in contest structure and rules for this season, in the interest of ensuring academic integrity:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>We have added text to our contest rules clarifying that generative AI is prohibited during our contests, and that USA students are not allowed to use VPNs to obscure their IP addresses.</li>
            <li><p>For USA students participating in a platinum contest, you will earn a certified score if you start the contest between 12:00 noon and 12:15 eastern time (ET) on the Saturday of the larger Friday-Monday contest timeframe. Certified scores carry more weight during finalist selection. This special timing currently only affects platinum contests, not other divisions. That is, platinum problems become available only at noon ET on the Saturday of the contest window; all other divisions can be launched earlier, on the Friday morning of the Friday-Monday contest timeframe. Students who wish to receive full consideration for selection as a finalist to attend our training camp should try to receive certified scores on all of the platinum contests. Realizing that schedules are sometimes hard to coordinate, students with three instead of four certified scores will still receive full consideration. Students who have fewer than three certified scores due to promotion from gold to platinum mid-season may also be considered for finalist status (in this case, the more certified scores, the better).</li></ul></p></h3>
